AlignACE</H3>
AlignACE (<B>Align</B>s Nucleic <B>A</B>cid <B>C</B>onserved <B>E</B>lements)
is a program which finds sequence elements conserved in a set of DNA sequences.&nbsp;
It uses a Gibbs sampling strategy which is similar to that described by A.
F. Neuwald, J.Liu and C.E. Lawrence in <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query?uid=8520488&form=6&db=m&Dopt=b">Gibbs
motif sampling: Detection of bacterial outer membrane protein repeats</A>&nbsp;
An iterative masking procedure is used to allow multiple distinct motifs to be found within 
a single data set.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
ScanACE</H3>
ScanACE (<B>Scan</B>s for Nucleic <B>A</B>cid <B>C</B>onserved <B>E</B>lements)
is a program which scans DNA sequence for elements which match a DNA motif.&nbsp;
It uses a weight matrix approach, with weights assigned by the method of
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query?uid=3612791&form=6&db=m&Dopt=b">Berg
and von Hippel</A>.&nbsp;
Given an appropriately formatted feature table such as the ORF table provided by SGD, ScanACE is 
also able to return information about the genomic environment of each site found.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>
<P>As of April 25, 1999, both Linux and Win 95/98/NT versions are available.  Some new features have been added to ScanACE as well.  You may obtain all files necessary for running AlignACE and ScanACE on a Linux or Windows 95/98/NT machine by indicating y
our acceptance of our licensing agreement and providing your name and email address below.
<P>
If your browser does not prompt you to save the file to disk, use the "Save As" function to save it as either alignace.zip (Windows) or alignace.tar.gz (Linux).  Follow customary procedures for 
each system to extract the archived contents.  Sample input files, output files, and support 
files for the <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> genome are included.

<FONT SIZE=-1>
AlignACE  ("The Program")<P>

GENERAL STATEMENT.<P>
The Program is a research tool still in the development stage.  This license Agreement is entered into in order to encourage scientific collaboration aimed at further development and use of The Program.
<P><P>
OWNERSHIP OF PROGRAM.<P>
The Program is protected by copyright laws and foreign treaties, and  is the subject of a United States patent application, all foreign rights protected. All title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in The Program shall remain in Presiden




t and Fellows of Harvard College.
<P><P>
GRANT OF RIGHTS.<P>
President and Fellows of Harvard College (hereinafter "HARVARD," "our") grants to LICENSEE (hereinafter "LICENSEE," "you," "your") a non-exclusive license to use The Program free of charge if (a) you are a student, faculty member or staff member of an edu




cational institution, or an employee of an organization which meets HARVARD's criteria for a charitable, religious, or not-for-profit organization; and (b) your use of The Program is not for (i) the production or manufacture of products for sale, nor (ii)




 the performance of services for a fee.  The Program is provided to you "as is," without any accompanying documentation, services or improvements from HARVARD.
<P><P>
DERIVATIVES.<P>
You may create Derivatives of The Program in any medium.  Any Derivatives you create shall be jointly owned by you and HARVARD.  You are required to place the proper copyright notice on such Derivatives.  (One acceptable form of such a notice is:  "©[Year




] President and Fellows of Harvard College and [Your Name].  All rights reserved.")  At HARVARD's election, you shall send a copy of Derivatives to HARVARD within sixty (60) days of receiving notice from HARVARD requesting such a copy.
The definition of the term "Derivatives," as used in this Agreement, includes translations of The Program to other foreign languages or other computer languages, adaptations of The Program to other hardware platforms, and all abridgments, condensations, r




evisions, modifications, enhancements you may make to The Program.
<P><P>
USE OF THE PROGRAM AND DERIVATIVES.<P>
You may:  Use The Program (or Derivatives) on any single computer; use The Program (or Derivatives) on a network, provided that each person accessing The Program (or Derivatives) through the network must have a copy licensed to that  person; use The Progr




am (or Derivatives) on a second computer so long as only one copy is used at a time; copy The Program (or Derivatives) for archival purposes - provided that any copy must contain all of The Program's (or Derivatives') copyright notices.
You may not:  Permit other individuals to use The Program (or Derivatives) except under the terms listed above; grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer rights to The Program (or Derivatives) ; or remove any copyright notices on The Program (or




 Derivatives).
