	The problem of DNA sequence classification is central to several application domains in molecular 
biology, genomics, metagenomics and genetics. Although several software tools have been developed for this problem,
it is still computationally challenging due to the 
size of datasets generated by modern sequencing instruments and the growing size of reference 
sequence databases. <br/>
We present <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-015-1419-2"><b>CLARK</b></a>, a method 
based on a supervised sequence classification using discriminative <i>k</i>-mers. 
Considering two distinct specific classification
 problems (see the article for details), namely (1) the taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads to known bacterial genomes, and 
(2) the assignment of BAC clones and transcript to chromosome arms/centromeres 
(in the absence of a finished assembly for the reference genome), CLARK outperforms
in classification speed and precision the best state-of-the-art methods. 
<br/><br/>
Three classifiers from the CLARK framework are provided:
<ul>
<li>
<b> CLARK </b> (default): created for powerful workstation, 
it can require a significant amount of RAM to run with large database (e.g., all bacterial genomes from
NCBI/RefSeq). This classifier is the standard in the CLARK tool series. 
It builds discriminative <i>k</i>-mers from all <i>k</i>-mers in the targets, queries <i>k</i>-mers with exact matching,
and, in its fastest mode, classifies 1 million short reads in few seconds...;
</li><li>
<b> CLARK-<i>l</i> </b>: created for workstations with limited memory 
(i.e., "<i>l</i>" for light), this software tool provides precise classification on small metagenomes. 
Indeed, for metagenomics analysis, CLARK-<i>l</i> works with a sparse or ''light'' database 
(up to 4 GB of RAM) while still performing ultra accurate and fast results.
This classifier builds discriminative <i>k</i>-mers from non-overlapping and distant <i>k</i>-mers in the targets and queries <i>k</i>-mers with exact matching;
</li><li>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw542"><b>CLARK-<i>S</i></b></a>: created for powerful workstations and exploiting spaced 
<i>k</i>-mers (i.e., "S" for spaced), this classifier requires a higher 
RAM usage than CLARK or CLARK-<i>l</i>, but it does offer a higher sensitivity than CLARK 
at the species level (see the peer-reviewed publication in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw542">Bioinformatics</a>).
CLARK-<i>S</i> completes the series of classifiers from the CLARK framework.
</li>
</ul>

Other applications of CLARK are, for example, the detection of contaminants, the identification of chimerism and vector contamination in sequenced BACs (cf. "Overview" tab).

        <td class="souligne">&nbsp; 
First, in the context of BACs assignments, CLARK shows a high discriminative power when assigning sequences 
to chromosome arms and, for the first time, centromeres labels to 15K barley BACs and 51K barley unigenes. 
The analysis of the confidence score of these assignments shows an average score of 0.924 which
indicates that the number of hits for the top target (which will receive the assignment) is about <b>12 times</b>
higher than the second.
<br/><br/>
Second, in the context of metagenomic classification (using the bacterial/archaeal genomes of NCBI/RefSeq),
extensive experimental results show that CLARK's classification precision and sensitivity, at the genus/species level,
 are better or equivalent than best state-of-the-art tools, and it is significantly faster than any published methods.
 CLARK, in its fastest mode, 
can classify short sequences of a simulated metagenome ("HiSeq", cf. "Simulated Datasets" below), 
at the speed of <b>32 million reads per minute</b> (single-threaded task),
which is at least <b>5 times faster than</b> Kraken
 (which is itself several order of magnitude faster than Megablast or other standard tools). 
While faster, CLARK also achieves ultra-high precision and 
requires less memory space in disk than Kraken or NBC (see the following table).
Finally, the analysis of the confidence score of these assignments shows an average confidence score of 0.998.
This implies that the number of hits for the top target is in average about <b>585 times</b>
higher than the second.
<br/><br/>

From the following table, we can compare NBC and Kraken against CLARK 
based on their <b>accuracy speed</b> (i.e., the number of correct reads produced per unit of time, or also <i>speed</i> x <i>sensitivity</i>). 
Observe that CLARK outperforms the other tools, and can produce <b>2.4 million</b> of correct reads per minute.

       <td class="souligne">
	<b>(A)</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; In the BMC Genomics paper (2015), we have tested CLARK against four simulated metagenomes. The three datasets "HiSeq", "MiSeq" and "simBA-5"
from the Kraken project were used, as well as the set of simulated reads, "simHC", from the <a href="http://fames.jgi-psf.org/">FAMeS project</a> 
(Fidelity of Analysis of Metagenomic Samples),
which simulates high complexity communities lacking dominant populations. 
The simHC dataset contains 113 subsets
of long Sanger reads from various known microbial genomes. We have chosen arbitrarily 20 subsets
corresponding to 20 distinct genomes (see the following table), and extracted the first 500 reads to build a set of 10,000 reads.
We call this resulting set of reads "simHC.20.500". We list below the 20 genomes
we used, identified by their specific ID (Integrated Microbial Genomes ID) and accessible in the Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) database. To download this dataset, go to the "FAQ" tab (Q12). 
<br/>
<img width="900" src="./tab_simHC20500.png" alt="Table 2"  />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Component genomes from the JGI database used in the "simHC.20.500" dataset.
<br/>
       <br/>
        <b>(B)</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; In the Bioinformatics paper (2016), we used fourteen simulated datasets to evaluate the precision and sensitivity of CLARK-<i>S</i>.
        We created six synthetic datasets (see the plots generated by <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/385">Krona</a> below for more detail) containing reads from dominant organisms found in the mouth
        (<b>Buc12</b>), city parks/medians (<b>CParMed48</b>), gut (<b>Gut20</b>), indoor (<b>Hou31</b> and <b>Hou21</b>) and soil (<b>Soi50</b>) environments.
        A seventh dataset (<b>simBA-525</b>) containing reads randomly chosen from 525 bacterial/archaeal species was added.
        These datasets are composed of short synthetic reads generated using <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/12/23/bioinformatics.btr708">ART</a>
        (Huang et al., 2012) with default settings. <br/><br/>
        However, observe that a short read <i>r</i> generated from genome <i>g<sub>i</sub></i> may also exist in an other genome for the same error rate or number of mismatches.
	        
	Ignoring the possibility of ambiguity in reads classiﬁcation is likely to lead to incorrect conclusions on precision and sensitivity. 
	In order to carry out an unbiased evaluation, we created additional datasets (called "unambiguous", see Supplemetary Note 2 of the CLARK-<i>S</i> paper for details),
 in which no read can be mapped to more than one species with the same error rate or number of mismatches.
        In total, we created fourteen datasets containing reads of size 100bp from 647 species. <br/><br/>

        We also added three <u>negative control</u> samples containing short reads that do not exist in any genomes in the NCBI/RefSeq database.
