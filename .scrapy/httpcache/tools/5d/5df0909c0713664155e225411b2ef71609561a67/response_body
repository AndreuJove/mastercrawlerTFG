		Aptamers are small, single-stranded DNA or RNA nucleotide sequences (&lt;100 residues) that recognize their ligands with an affinity equal or superior to antibodies. 
		These small molecules are <i>not immunogenic</i>, have a <i>high capacity to penetrate tissues</i> and can be <i>easily modified to regulate their half-life or conjugated with drugs</i>. 
		Aptamers are selected in vitro through the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) procedure. 
		SELEX and HT-SELEX (i.e., SELEX combined with high-throughput sequencing) are iterative processes that enrich DNA and RNA aptamer libraries with sequences characterized by 
		high affinity and selectivity toward a target ligand. Historically, a SELEX experiment required several rounds of selection (&gt;15) thus increasing a variety of intrinsic pitfalls.
		In recent years, the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies revolutionized the SELEX technique, drastically reducing the number of cycles, thus improving performances.</br>
		Lead aptamers are commonly selected from SELEX data using computational methods that consider the relative sequence abundance (frequency) at the various cycles of the SELEX enrichment. 
		However, the ability of aptamers to recognize and bind their cognate partners depends not only on their abundance, but also on unique three-dimensional structures 
		formed by the folding of the aptamer sequences into various secondary structures (as hairpin, loop, bulge, and G-quadruplex). 
		The structural properties and motifs predicted in these sequences may be exploited in computational tools to select leading aptamers that are more likely to interact with a ligand.</br>
		Here, we present <b>APTANI</b> and <b>APTANI<sup>2</sup></b>, two methods for selecting potentially relevant aptamers through a sequence-structure analysis. 
		Both tools contain modules to predict specific secondary structures in each selection round and to rank aptamers by motifs embedded in their predicted structures.

	<b>APTANI</b> consists of four major steps. The <b>first step</b> calculates the frequencies of the aptamer sequences produced by the SELEX process. 
	Given the input file, APTANI calculates the frequency of each individual aptamer sequence by dividing the number of occurrences of each sequence by the total number of analyzed sequences. 
	Frequency counts can be quantified either using the whole aptamer sequence or only its variable region, e.g., to count only those sequences that change during the SELEX process. 
	Setting a threshold on the frequency counts, the pool of original aptamers can be filtered to select only high frequent aptamers for the further steps. 
	In the <b>second step</b>, APTANI predicts the secondary structure of each aptamer that passes the frequency filter, and extracts all motifs represented in these structures. 
	As secondary structures, we consider four loop structures: hairpins, bulge (either right or left) and intra-strands. 
	By default, this step is performed on the whole aptamer sequence, but the user can choose to investigate only the variable region. 
	In this case, the variable region will be merged with the flanking constant regions to include motifs that are across that specific portion. 
	In the <b>third step</b>, we assume that if a motif is shared by a large fraction of the sampled aptamer pool, it is highly probable that it will emerge as highly populated, 
	even if we do not use the entire pool of aptamer sequences. Thus, a number of aptamers and their secondary structure motifs are randomly picked from the output of 
	the previous step and their sequences are aligned to each other to obtain a consensus sequence. The step is iteratively repeated for a number of times defined by the user. 
	In the <b>last step</b>, each consensus sequence generated in the previous step is matched with the relative loop structure pool. 
	Specifically, each nucleotide of the consensus sequence is matched with the respective nucleotide of the pool sequence to calculate an identity matching score based 
	on an identity/non-identity scoring system (with a fixed gap penalty of -0.5). Finally, APTANI returns an output table, containing all results of the 
	various steps and a clustered tree of sequences that passed the frequency filter.</br>

	<b>APTANI<sup>2</sup></b> builds on the evidence that sequence motifs with a significant binding potential are enriched at a given SELEX cycle and have an intrinsic high stability 
	across the secondary structures of different aptamers. Therefore, in APTANI<sup>2</sup> potentially relevant aptamers are selected using a scoring function that integrates 
	the frequency and the stability of each motif retrieved in any aptamer sequence. The core of APTANI<sup>2</sup> consists of three major steps: 
	<b>step 1)</b> quantification of aptamer frequency; <b>step 2)</b> identification of motifs associated to secondary structures; and <b>step 3)</b> scoring of sequence motifs and aptamers.</br>
	The <b>first step</b> calculates the relative frequency of each aptamer sequence produced by the SELEX process, as described in the original APTANI. 
	In the <b>second step</b>, aptamers that pass the frequency filter are processed with RNASubopt to predict all possible secondary structures 
	within a range of 3 Kcal/mol above the minimum free energy (MFE). 
	Each predicted secondary structure is then investigated to retrieve all the associated hairpin, intra-strand, bulge (left and right), and G-quadruplex sequence motifs. 
	In the <b>third step</b>, first each motif is characterized in terms of frequency and structural stability of the related secondary structure through a motif score (<i>MtfScore</i>) 
	calculated using each motif frequency and relative stability (defined as the ratio between the median energy value of all secondary structures containing a given motif 
	and the lowest Minimum Free Energy of all predicted secondary structures). Then, the distribution of the <i>MtfScore</i> values is used to define the top scoring motifs 
	as those motifs with an MtfScore greater than e.g., the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of the <i>MtfScore</i> distribution. 
	Finally, each aptamer is ranked according to an aptamer score <i>AptScore</i> that quantifies, in each sequence, 
	the normalized abundance of top scoring motifs given the total number of retrieved motifs.</br>
	APTANI<sup>2</sup> comprises three additional post-analysis modules to inspect the evolution of aptamer enrichment along the SELEX process (<i>Evolution Analyzer</i>), 
	to retrieve motifs in aptamer sequences (<i>Motif Fetcher</i>), and to visualize their predicted folding and motif structure (<i>grAPhTANI</i>). 
	Outputs are in the form of tables and graphical representations to facilitate the downstream interpretation of results. 
	In addition to the command line scripts, the tool is accessible through a graphic user interface (GUI) that simplifies the input selection and parameter setting 
	through pre-compiled fields in a point-and-click environment.</br>
