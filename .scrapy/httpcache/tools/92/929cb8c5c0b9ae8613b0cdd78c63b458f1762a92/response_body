	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>The RNA Informatics group is a collaborative effort among computer scientist / mathematicians and biologists at the 
		University of Georgia which currently includes four faculty - Liming Cai (Computer Science), Russell Malmberg (Plant Biology), 
		Bob Robinson (Computer Science and Mathematics), and Cory Momany (Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences) - we began in 2002 
		when Liming and Russell met and found common interests.  We work in a number of areas of bioinformatics, especially those 
		which require development and implementation of new computational methods.</p>
	<p>The specific focus of our efforts has been the biological macromolecule RNA and its structure.  RNAs are key molecules in 
		cells and organisms, with roles as informational molecules, functional (enzymatic) molecules, and regulatory functions controlling 
		other molecules and processes.  There are tens of thousands of kinds of RNAs, with large amounts of primary sequence data being 
		continually generated; computational algorithms are needed to analyze all the data and to predict features, structures and 
		functions for these RNA sequences.  In our research we develop novel algorithms and software to model RNA structure and predict 
		various features of RNAs from their primary sequence.</p>
	<p>The computational methods we use are often based upon graph theory and on machine learning as methods to model RNA structures.  
		We develop new approaches to reducing computational complexity, making a problem, which initially seems to have high computational 
		complexity, feasible to solve in a reasonable time.  Most of these ideas are Liming's.</p>
	<p>We are especially pleased with the successes our student alumni have had in their careers, since graduating from the University 
		of Georgia and from our research group.</p>
