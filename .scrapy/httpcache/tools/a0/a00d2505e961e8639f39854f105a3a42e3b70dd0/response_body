<br>AMYLPRED2 is an improved version of a web tool (<a href="http://biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/AMYLPRED/" target="_blank">http://biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/AMYLPRED/</a>)
 that was developed in our lab in the past (2009).  It employs a consensus of different methods that have been found or 
 specifically developed to predict features related to the formation of amyloid fibrils.  The consensus of these methods
 is defined as the hit overlap of at least n/2 (rounded down) out of n selected methods (i.e. 5 out of 11 methods, if the
 user chooses to use <b>all</b> available methods). This is the primary output of the program.  However, the individual predictions
 of these methods are also made available by pressing the button "Show/hide methods".  Furthermore, a consensus histogram is
 shown by pressing the button "Show/hide consensus". All results are also made available in the form of a text file, maintained
 on the server for 1 (one) day. Consequently, AMYLPRED is a useful tool for identifying amyloid-forming regions in proteins that are associated with several conformational diseases, called amyloidoses, such as Altzheimer's, Parkinson's, prion diseases, type II diabetes etc. It may also be useful for understanding the properties of protein folding and misfolding and for helping to the control of protein aggregation/solubility in biotechnology (recombinant proteins forming bacterial inclusion bodies) and biotherapeutics (monoclonal antibodies and biopharmaceutical proteins).

     <p class="normalg">AGGRESCAN is a web tool (<a href="http://bioinf.uab.es/aggrescan/" target="_blank">http://bioinf.uab.es/aggrescan/</a>) 
	 for the prediction of 'aggregation-prone' segments in protein sequences. It is based on an aggregation propensity scale for
	 natural amino acids derived from <i>in vivo</i> experiments and on the assumption that short and specific sequence stretches
	 modulate protein aggregation.

	 <br>
     <p class="normalg">AmyloidMutants is a web-based tool (<a href="http://amyloid.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">http://amyloid.csail.mit.edu/</a>)
	 for predicting the structural and mutational landscapes of amyloid fibrils using an ensemble algorithm.
	 Each peptide sequence is considered to fold into a complete set of millions (or billions) of unique structural states,
	 with a single energetic value calculated for each state according to its entire conformation <i>(McCaskill, 1990)</i>. From this
	 quantified set of all possible structures, clusters of low-energy states with similar conformations can be extracted as
	 predictions of likely real-world structures, with relative probabilities of occurrence. Because calculating the energy
	 of all mathematically possible interactions would introduce an exponential number of states as a function of sequence
	 length, this method uses «schemas» as an algorithmic construct to solve this by partitioning fibrillar from non-fibrillar
	 conformations, enforcing steric consistency and restricting energetic calculations over amyloid fibril sequence/structure
	 states. AmyloidMutants requires a set of parameters for each submission. The default values and the cross-beta pleat
	 (serpentine) structural scheme are used here.

	 Submissions are scanned for the existence of this pattern {P}-{PKRHW}-[VLSCWFNQE]-[ILTYWFNE]-[FIY]-{PKRH} at
	 identity level, with the use of a simple custom script.

	 <li><b>Average Packing Density</b>
	 <br>
     <p class="normalg">This method relates the Average Packing Density of stretches of residues to the formation of amyloid
	 fibrils. A script implementing the method has been written in our lab <i>(Hamodrakas et al., Int.Journ. of Biol.Macromolecules 41(2007) 295-300.)</i>.
	 Values above 21.4 obtained from a five-residue long sliding window are considered as hits.

	 <li><b>Beta-strand contiguity</b>
	 <br>
     <p class="normalg">This is a simple algorithm that locates &beta;-strands in the amyloid fibril core using the amino acid
	 sequence alone. The algorithm calculates an average &beta;-strand propensity score for peptide windows of different sizes
	 (from 4 to 20 residues) within a polypeptide's sequence. The algorithm samples the full length of the protein’s sequence
	 by sliding each window along, one residue at a time. A mean &beta;-strand propensity (M&beta;P) score is calculated for each 
	 peptide window, according to this equation: M&beta;P = &Sigma;P<sub>&beta;</sub> / [0.5 x (&Sigma;P<sub>&alpha;</sub>+ 
	 &Sigma;P<sub>t</sub>)], where &Sigma;P<sub>&beta;</sub>, &Sigma;P<sub>&alpha;</sub> and &Sigma;P<sub>t</sub> 
	 are the sums of Chou and Fasman &beta;-strand, &alpha;-helix, and reverse
	 turn preference parameters, respectively <i>(Chou and Fasman, 1978)</i>
	 for every residue in a peptide window. Then x-y plots are produced from compilation of these M&beta;P scores, which are 
	 plotted as a y-coordinate against the amino acid sequence, which is along the x-axis. For each residue along the 
	 sequence, the value for the y-coordinate is produced by adding together the M&beta;P scores above a minimum threshold
	 value (M&beta;P >= 1.2) from every window that contains that particular residue. Total y values above 20 are considered
	 as hits. A script implementing the algorithm has been written in our lab.

	 <li><b>Hexapeptide Conformational Energy</b>
	 <br>
     <p class="normalg">This program threads all hexapeptides of a submitted protein onto the microcrystallic structure 
	 of NNQQNY. Alternatively the program can use a set of over 2500 templates produced by small shifts in the structure
	 of NNQQNY. In our consensus method, the version using only the original structure is used, in favour of speed. Energy 
	 values below -27.00 are considered as hits.

	 <br>
	 <i>Z. Zhang, H. Chen, L. Lai, (2007) Bioinformatics vol.23 no.17 2218-2225.</i>
	 <br><br>
     NOTE: The original program executes interactively. For use in an automated method it was necessary to modify it in
	 a way that it would allow options to be passed as arguments. Also, a small modification to the memory demands of the
	 program was made. The use of only one structure as template made the use of a large multidimensional array (used to 
	 store energy results when all 2500+ templates are used) unnecessary. This large array prevented the program from
	 executing on many computers.

	 <li><b>NetCSSP</b>

     <p class="normalg">This is a computational method (<a href="http://cssp2.sookmyung.ac.kr/" target="_blank">http://cssp2.sookmyung.ac.kr/</a>)
     that quantifies the influence of tertiary interaction on secondary structural preference. Artificial neural network 
	 (ANN)-based algorithms that use preparameterized tertiary interactions with sequence inputs from users are designed
	 to predict contact-dependent secondary structure propensities (CSSPs). NetCSSP calculates these propensities for the
	 center residue in a seven-residue sliding window. There is a choice between single or dual network. Here, we use the dual 
	 network as it has greater accuracy. The dual network architecture consists of two single networks that use distinct 
	 output nodes. One network has output nodes for &alpha;-helix and non-helix, thus predicting helical propensity P(helix). 
	 The other network has output nodes for &beta;-strand and non-beta strand, thus predicting beta propensity P(beta). 
	 NetCSSP can be used to predict the core sequences of amyloid fibril formation where the switch in local secondary
	 structure occurs. The amyloidogenic hidden beta propensity (H&beta;P) is calculated using the form H&beta;P = P(beta)/P(helix).
	 Residues with values of H&beta;P above 1 and of P(beta) above 6 are considered as hits.

	 is a method based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), for the identification of hexpeptides associated with
	 amyloid fibrillar aggregates. The predictive model of Pafig is a phenomenological model, which was based
	 on 41 physicochemical properties selected by a two-round selection from 531 physicochemical properties in
	 the Amino acid index database (AAindex). Pafig was trained by hexpeptides, which were decomposed by scanning
	 for segments that could form fibrils with a six-residue sliding window. Predictions with Reliability Index
	 (RI) greater than or equal to 7 are considered as hits.

     <p class="normalg">This method (<a href="http://waltz.switchlab.org/" target="_blank">http://waltz.switchlab.org/</a>) 
	 uses a position-specific scoring matrix to determine amyloid-forming sequences. A sequence score S<sub>profile</sub> is
	 calculated from the log-odd based position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). Nineteen selected physical properties, which best
	 describe amyloid propensity enter the scoring function as a physical property term S<sub>physprop</sub> consisting of the sum of 
	 the products of the amino acid frequency with the normalized property value of the respective amino acid for each
	 position. The final component of the scoring function S<sub>struct</sub> is the position-specific pseudoenergy matrix from 
	 structural  modeling  using  amyloid backbone structures. Relative weightings a of individual terms was introduced for
	 a balanced scoring function (S<sub>total</sub> = a<sub>profile</sub> S<sub>profile</sub> + a<sub>physprop</sub>
	 S<sub>physprop</sub> + a<sub>struct</sub> S<sub>struct</sub>). There are two options to be set, threshold and pH. Here, a threshold value of 79.0 
	 (High Sensitivity) and pH = 7.0 are used.
