  <h1>What is Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD)?</h1>
<p>
    CADD is a tool for scoring the deleteriousness of single nucleotide variants as well as
    insertion/deletions variants in the human genome.
</p>
<p>
    While many variant annotation and scoring tools are around, most annotations
    tend to exploit a single information type (e.g. conservation) and/or
    are restricted in scope (e.g. to missense changes). Thus, a broadly applicable metric
    that objectively weights and integrates diverse information is needed.
    Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a framework that
    integrates multiple annotations into one metric by contrasting variants that
    survived natural selection with simulated mutations.
</p>
<p>
    C-scores strongly correlate with allelic
    diversity, pathogenicity of both coding and non-coding variants, and
    experimentally measured regulatory effects, and also highly rank causal variants
    within individual genome sequences. Finally, C-scores of complex
    trait-associated variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are
    significantly higher than matched controls and correlate with study sample size,
    likely reflecting the increased accuracy of larger GWAS.
</p>
<p>
    CADD can quantitatively prioritize functional, deleterious, and disease causal
    variants across a wide range of functional categories, effect sizes and genetic
    architectures and can be used prioritize causal variation in
    both research and clinical settings.
</p>
<p>
    Our latest manuscript describes the updates since the initial publication of
    CADD and how we envision its use. It was published by
    Nucleic Acids Research in 2018:

<h1>How can I obtain CADD scores?</h1>
<p>
    CADD scores are freely available for all non-commercial applications. If
    you are planning on using them in a commercial application, you can obtain a license through the <a target="_blank" href="https://els2.comotion.uw.edu/product/cadd-scores">UW CoMotion Express Licensing System</a>. If in doubt about whether you need a license for your application, please contact
    <a href="http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/people.html" target="_blank">Jay Shendure</a> and
    <a href="https://hudsonalpha.org/faculty/greg-cooper/" target="_blank">Gregory M. Cooper</a>.
    CADD is currently developed by <a
        href="https://www.bihealth.org/en/research/junior-groups/martin-kircher/" target="_blank">Martin Kircher</a>, <a
        href="https://github.com/aerval" target="_blank"> Philipp Rentzsch</a>, <a

        href="http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/people.html" target="_blank">Jay Shendure</a>.
</p>
<p>
    We have pre-computed CADD-based scores (C-scores) for all <a
    href="/download">8.6 billion possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of
    the reference genome, a selection of short insertion/deletions as well as some large variant sets (e.g. gnomAD, ExAC, 1000 Genomes, ESP).</a> We also provide a <a href="/snv">simple lookup for SNVs</a> and <a href="/score">enable scoring
    of short insertions/deletions</a>. Ranges of scores can be visualized in <a target="_blank" href="/genome-browser">UCSC Genome Browser</a> (for <a target="_blank" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&hubUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kircherlab/CADD-browserTracks/master/hub.txt">hg19/GRCh37</a>
