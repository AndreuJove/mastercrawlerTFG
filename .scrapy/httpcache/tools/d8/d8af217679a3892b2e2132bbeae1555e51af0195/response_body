  <li> <strong>Summary</strong>. This software simulates chromosomal rearrangements 
    produced by ionizing radiation during the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. It 
    gives a cell-by-cell record of simulated rearrangements, much as in an actual 
    experiment. Simulated relative frequencies and simulated dose-response curves 
    for various types of aberrations can also be obtained. The simulations establish 
    baseline randomness predictions, thereby suggesting a systematic way to organize 
    the data of any particular experiment. 
    <p>The program uses the classic (i.e., random breakage and reunion) radiation 
      aberration model, modified to incorporate proximity effects. All rearrangements 
      are assumed complete, leaving no unrejoined ends. The model is implemented 
      via Monte-Carlo simulations (Chen et al. 1997). Scoring appropriate for 
      conventional staining, or for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments 
      involving whole-chromosome painting with additional colors, is included. 
      Aberrations are divided into different types according to the classification 
      schemes of Savage (1976), S&amp;S (Savage and Simpson 1994), PAINT (Tucker 
      et al. 1995), or Chen et al. (1996). Chromosome arm lengths for human or 
      non-human genomes can be systematically taken into account by extending 
      to FISH scoring and to complex aberrations methods which are standard (Savage 
      and Papworth 1982, Lucas et al. 1992, Hlatky et al. 1992) for dicentrics 
      and rings.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Input</strong>. In order to perform simulations, the user specifies 
    the following: 
    <ol>
      <ol>
        <li> the number of chromosomes;</li>
        <li> if known, the relative lengths of the chromosomes, and their centromere 
          locations;</li>
        <li> the chromosome staining/painting system being simulated;</li>
        <li> the average number of reactive double strand breaks per cell per 
          unit dose (related to the sensitivity of the cells);</li>
        <li> the number of interaction sites in one cell (an integer related to 
          the magnitude of proximity effects). </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>The last two numbers (<strong>4</strong> &amp; <strong>5</strong>) must 
      be adjusted to the experiment being simulated. Their values are obtained 
      either from the literature, or by trial and error using the program itself 
      and comparing simulated to experimental frequencies. Thereafter per-cell 
      frequencies for all kinds of simple or complex aberrations can be simulated.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Output</strong>. For conventional staining, or for one FISH color 
    and one counterstain, or for two FISH colors and one counterstain, the software 
    tabulates simulated frequencies for certain aberration types, e.g. dicentrics, 
    centric rings, two-color translocations, insertions, 3-way interchanges, etc. 
    Typically a million cells can be simulated. For any FISH experiment, with 
    any number of colors, an additional &quot;details&quot; file contains cell-by-cell 
    records of visibly rearranged chromosomes up to the first 1,000 cells. If 
    more cells are needed the simulation can be repeated. Various quantities of 
    interest can be estimated by using these cell-by-cell data. Examples include: 
    frequencies for those aberration types whose frequency is not computed automatically; 
    or the average number of color junctions per cell; or the fraction of cell 
    genomes which are unstable (i.e. non-transmissible, i.e. have damage putatively 
    fatal at mitosis (Savage, 1995)); etc. Users can get such additional results 
    automatically if they modify the source code slightly. The simulations can 
    include doses other than the doses used in the actual experiment; they can 
    also include extra information not available in an experiment but implied 
    by the model and its parameters (e.g., in a FISH experiment, the total frequency 
    of dicentrics, painted or not, in the whole genome).<br>
    Detailed cell-by-cell information is restricted to 1,000 cells per run, but 
    summary information on aberration frequencies can utilize much larger numbers 
    of simulated cells. Calculation time depends on the cell number, average number 
    of reactive DSBs and platform. In our hands, calculations with a Pentium PC 
    take less than a minute for 1,000 cells and take 10 minutes - 1 hour for 1,000,000 
    cells (and take even more time when the number of reactive DSBs is unusually 
    large).</li>
